    <!-- I have plenty of hobbies. I love drawing and sketching,
    making short videocuts. I enjoy taking pictures. 
    I'm really interested in art and I love to gain new
    information  on different artistic personalities and their 
    creations. I also find  languages learning exiciting and
    I think it can broaden your possibilities. I love creating
    websites as well, especially making animation.
    Another my passion is neuroscience and neurobiology. I learn 
    about brain structure, how all it works and there's so many
    to learn to!-->

                <p>I like to draw small sketches, mostly people's heads. 
                    Pinterest inspires me, it's where I find references. 
                    And people. There are dozens of people who inspire me.

                <p>I take short videos of my friends and family 
                    and then I combine it together to make short funny
                    memorable videocuts. I Love taking photos and try to 
                    capture moments that i think are interesting.  I have never 
                    really pursued anything with photography, but 
                    it is something I enjoy doing on my own.

                <p>I love listening to music and taking photos.  
                    I listen to so many different types of music 
                    that I canâ€™t even pick a favorite genre.  Each
                    day I seem to be in the mood for something 
                    different, and I constantly go through phases 
                    of loving one genre for a week and then switching
                    the next week.
